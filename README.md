↳- **Interactions** -༉‧₊˚✧

*C+H is welcome! I block if I feel uncomfortable Idgaf.*

*If I interact with you, one of them is either because...* 🎤

- I am interested in you.
- I have no one to talk to.
- I like your personality/avatar.

*If I don't respond or interact back to you, one of them is either because...* 💭
- I'm afk.
- I'm opening other app/offtab.
- I'm drawing/making characters.
- I accidentally fall asleep (15% chances, it happens to me 5 times bruh).

  *If my responses is too slow, then it's either I'm trying to think of a response or I'm talking to someone else in rl.*

  *I rarely use abbreviation and talk too formal sometimes so forgive me if I sound too dry.*


**NOTE :**

I know all Pokémon medias *except* for the anime. I *hate* Goh, Chloe and Journey vers. Ash. They sucks.

For PokéSpe/manga, I *only know* the characters and not the storyline.

Also sign my strawpage! (strawpage currently having problems receiving drawing so yeah-)

I *fictkin* for Ethan (and all his Poképasta vers.), Slingshot, and Karl/Unnamed 1. Garde zu Fuß officer! ^^ (I doubt there'll be doubles cause ya'll fictkin either Blue, Red, or Silver).
